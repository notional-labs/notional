# Notional

## Mission

Founded at the launch of Osmosis in 2021 in a small apartment in Hanoi, Vietnam, we have already grown to a team of over 30 people, validating more than 40 blockchains, and are contributing development work to over 12 different Cosmos projects.

Notional is working to deliver value to our shareholders by accelerating the global shift to fair, transparent, and accountable networked systems in the areas of:

* Governance
* Finance
* Personal Sovereignty

## Values 
At Notional, we strive to adhere to four core values:

1. Integrity
2. Transparency
3. Alignment
4. Excellence

For us, integrity means that nothing we do becomes predatory. Our users need to feel that they are welcomed and supported, not being exploited by cheap narratives and false hope.

Cryptocurrencies are built on a philosophy of transparency and we are working towards building this into Notional’s systems as well. If our community wants information about what we are doing, we want it to be easy to find and easy to process.

Alignment is critical — it ensures that teams are working towards common goals, and cooperating rather than competing for resources and attention. It ensures that everyone is on the same page.

Finally, if a given task or project meets all of our above values, we strive to deliver excellent work. We want to contribute to systems that we believe will exist for decades and we need to make sure that these contributions pass the highest possible levels of scrutiny.

## Services

Notional provides services in blockchain technology, including:

### [Validation](./validation)

Notional proudly validates and maintains approximately 40 Cosmos blockchains. This means that you can delegate your funds to us on any of these chains for the opportunity to earn a portion of our block rewards. We run exclusively on-site bare metal validators. The computers that run your favourite chains are on our premises being looked after 24/7.

### [Relaying](./relaying)
We run relayers — the computers that facilitate the transfer of IBC packets between Cosmos blockchains. At the present time, these relayers are not incentivized, but they are a pillar in the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling its renowned interoperability. We currently relay for every chain that we validate.

### [Software Development](./development)
we believe that understanding the codebase of a project is a critical part of being a node operator, but we go way beyond just understanding. Our team of software developers is capable of contributing a variety of services to any established or fledgling Cosmos project including:
* Custom SDK Modules
* CosmWasm Smart contracts
* Full Cosmos blockchains
* Blockchain genesis and launch
* Testing and Testnet bootstrapping
* [Snapshots](https://snapshot.notional.ventures/)

### Security and Consulting
As one of the most experienced and technically proficient teams in the Cosmos, we occasionally offer our advice to other teams trying to bring their ideas to market. We can advise on product strategy and development, keep teams informed on important industry updates, and provide on-call support for CometBFT and Cosmos SDK-related issues.

We also provide security audits, with the hope of preventing serious contagions from entering the Cosmos and harming the users who trust in it. Our security team have revealed issues across a wide array of Cosmos projects already. 
 
Finally, we love conversations with folks looking to invest in this ecosystem. Because of our unique vantage point on the interchain, we are happy to advise venture capital and private investment funds on where and how to allocate capital in the Cosmos.
